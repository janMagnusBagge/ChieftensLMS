var result = await <async method>;


MethodNameAsync (the suffix is convention)

best practice to await tasks that return
task. This is because u can wrap the await
in try catch and catch a exception.

DONT WRITE CODE THAT IS UNHANDELED
IN A ASYNC VOID METHOD.

Run more tasks simulatiously:

await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3);
it returns a task itself.

u can also do
await
await 
await 

but this is not pararell

configureAwat false in asp.net gives
better processing.
